        The Gwen’s Girls AFTER SCHOOL/SUMMER CAMP Program is a safe place for children to learn appropriate<br/>
        behavior, new skills and develop a sense of self-awareness.  Girls are taught how to manage their emotions<br/>
        and advocate for themselves in a variety of settings.  Gwen’s Girls follows the 7 Commitments of Sanctuary:<br/>
        A commitment of Non-Violence, Emotional Intelligence, Social Learning,  Open Communication, Social<br/>
        Responsibility, Democracy, and Growth {andVal} Change.  Girls are encouraged to work out their problems via<br/>
        Sanctuary model which addresses trauma, wrong doings and managing feelings.  Adults encourage youth<br/>
        to participate in community and red flag meetings which allow everyone to respond in a way that supports<br/>
        the child’s feelings while also setting limits on behavior.  Adults will use positive guidance to influence and  <br/>
        reinforce positive behaviors and will not use harmful techniques like humiliating, hollering, frightening your <br/>
        child or the use of physical punishment. <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Incentive Program</b> <br/>
    In an effort to maintain a safe environment and reinforce positive behaviors, Gwen’s Girls will use a<br/>
    points/reward system.  Points can then be redeemed at a set time from our GG Store.<br/><br/>
    Points are earned for: <br/>
    <b>1.</b> Education - complete assignments and activities given for academic enrichment<br/>
    <b>2.</b> Social Responsibility - displaying respect for self/others/property, following directions, complying with<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;staff, etc.<br/>
    <b>3.</b> Participation<br/>
    <b>4.</b> Attendance<br/>
    <b>5.</b> Leadership<br/><br/>
    <b>Discipline Procedures</b><br/>
    Gwen’s Girls believes in working with the girl and her family in maintaining appropriate behaviors and<br/>
    a safe environment for all those who attend.  In the event the rules and expectations are not followed,<br/>
    the following disciplinary system is in place:<br/><br/>

    <b>1.</b> Contact to parent/guardian regarding child’s behavior(s). Girls receive a written warning of<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;misconduct for inappropriate behaviors.<br/>
    <b>2.</b> If behaviors continue, a meeting will be scheduled with Gwen’s Girls, the child and parent to<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address problem behaviors.<br/>
    <b>3.</b> A behavioral contract will be developed with Gwen’s Girls, the child and parent to address<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem behaviors.<br/><br/>

    I, the undersigned, acknowledge that I have read, understand, and will adhere to Gwen’s Girls’<br/>
    code of ethics and privacy and will keep any and all information acquired during my participation<br/>
    at Gwen’s Girls confidential.<br/><br/><br/></p>
